## **Project Briefing:** 






This application **(The Meal suggestion App)** was completed as an assignment for course IMAD5112. This application gives quick meal suggestions for users to have as they go through their busy days. I programmed the application using Android Studio and Kotlin. 




### Aim and Important Feature


  

Objective: This application is exclusively developed to help users get a quick meal suggestion which they can have for the rest of the day.
  



Important Feature: The Generation Button for Meal Suggestions 




The feature allows generation of a quicker suggestion so that the user can have a food suggestion by the time of day. 



  
### Things considered for app design: 




Main considerations in the design of Meal Suggestion App are: 




Easy user experience : The app focused on smooth use and a very rich User Interface. 



Responsiveness: Developed to have the best display on different screens, which is taken care of regarding compatibility for a wide range of devices. 


  

Minimalism: The design is simple and not confusing for a user.

### Problems vs. How I solved them



During this application development, some challenges started to appear that delayed the creation of the application and thus consumed a long time which was not expected. 




**Challenge:** Develop code that that enables the user to get results even if they input their time of day in small caps.



**How i solved it:** I struggled in terms of fixing it. 




**Challenge:** Commit and push the project to GitHub 



**How i solved it:** Youtube video content made the task easier to understand.

  



### Future Work 




Below is a list of future feature add-ons that I think will improve user experience within the app: 




 **1:** The app should send notifications to users by reminding them to use the app every day. 





**2:** Allowing users to store and back up data 



  

**3:** Create a community of users inside the app where they can exchange new ideas. 



  

These additions serve to make the application more versatile and usable.
