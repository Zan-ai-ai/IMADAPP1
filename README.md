**Project Meeting:** The Meal Suggestion App Project 



  

This work was completed as an assignment for course IMAD5112. This application gives quick meal suggestions for users to have as they go through their busy days. I programmed the application using Android Studio and Kotlin. 

  



### Aim and Important Feature


  

Objective: This application is exclusively developed to help users get a quick meal suggestion which they can have for the rest of the day.
  



Important feature: Meal Suggestion Generation Button 




The feature allows the generation of a quick suggestion so that the user can have a food suggestion by the time of day. 



  
### Design Considerations: 




Core considerations in the design of Meal Suggestion App are: 




Easy user experiiance : The app focused on smooth use and a very rich User Interface. 




Responsiveness: Developed to have the best display on different screens, which is taken care of regarding compatibility for a wide range of devices. 


  

Minimalism: The design is simple and not confusing for a user.

### Problems and How I solved them



During this application development, some challenges started to appear that delayed the creation of the application and thus consumed a long time which was not expected. 




Challenge: Develop code that will make the app effective even if the user inputs the time of day in small letters. 



How i solved it: Unfortunately, I couldn't fix it. 




Challenge: Commit and push the project to GitHub 



How i solved it: Assistance from Youtube Video Tutorials made it easier to understand the content 

  



Future Work 




Below are future feature additions that I think will improve user experience within the app: 




 1: The app should send notifications to users by reminding them to use the app every day. 





2: Allowing users to store and back up data 



  

3: Create a community of users inside the app where they can exchange new ideas. 



  

These additions serve to make the application more versatile and usable.
